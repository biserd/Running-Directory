1) Races calendar (USA-wide) — legit sources

Primary: RunSignUp API

GET https://api.runsignup.com/rest/races supports state/city/zip+radius and modified_since for delta updates.

RunSignUp also states that without authentication you can pull all public races (public data).

Secondary: ACTIVE Network Activity APIs

Built specifically so third parties can distribute event/activity listings from ACTIVE.com; it’s read-only public data with documented limits.

Optional / partner-only: Let’s Do This

They have an API, but “list events” requires special marketplace credentials (so this is partnership-based, not open).

✅ Result: you can cover a huge portion of US races with RunSignUp + ACTIVE, and add more partners later.

2) Routes directory (USA-wide) — you generate it (no providers)

OpenStreetMap (OSM) data

Use OSM under ODbL; you must provide proper attribution.

For scalable ingestion, use Geofabrik US extracts (updated daily; machine-downloadable .osm.pbf).

Routing engine (to generate loops + GPX)

Self-host Valhalla (OSM routing engine) to generate route geometry + variants.
(You can also use OSRM, but don’t rely on public demo servers for heavy usage.)

✅ Result: “Best 5-mile routes in X city” becomes a repeatable data product you own.

3) Elevation + “flatness/difficulty” scoring (legit)

USGS 3DEP elevation

USGS elevation datasets are generally public domain / usable without restriction (attribution requested).

4) Running conditions pages (optional, but great)

Weather: NOAA/NWS API

National Weather Service API is free open data (with reasonable rate limits) and requires a User-Agent string.

Air quality: EPA AirNow API

Public AQI forecasts/observations with an API key (free to request).

The “legit data” implementation pattern

For every record you publish, store:

source + external_id + external_url

fetched_at, last_modified_at, last_seen_at

and show “Last updated” on page

Then refresh:

Races: daily delta (modified_since) where available

Routes: monthly regeneration / validation from OSM extracts
