You are a senior product + UX designer + information architect. Design the initial USA-wide directory structure + navigation + page templates for a website called running.services.

Product goal

running.services is a data-driven running hub that includes:

Race Calendar (USA-wide) (core)

Running Routes (USA-wide)

Tools Hub that links out to my existing tools on https://aitracker.run
 (must be prominent but not spammy)

Optional sections we may add later: Shoe Deals, Running Conditions, Guides

This site must be programmatic-SEO ready at USA scale (states → cities → detail pages) and designed so we can generate thousands of pages from data. We are NOT relying on providers “claiming” listings for this MVP.

Deliverables you must produce

Sitemap + URL structure (exact path patterns) for USA scale

Navigation structure (header + footer + breadcrumbs rules)

Template definitions (what sections/components appear on each page type)

Taxonomy + filters per directory (what filters exist and how they appear)

Internal linking strategy (modules that cross-link races/routes/tools/guides for SEO)

Page title/meta patterns (rules-based patterns, not final copy)

Mobile-first UI with clean, modern layout suitable for a fast directory site

Required information architecture (must include these top-level sections)

Top-level nav (desktop): Races, Routes, Tools, Guides, (optional later: Deals, Conditions)
Top-level on mobile: hamburger + quick search.

Required directory hierarchy (USA-ready)

Design path patterns that support:

USA hub

State hubs

City/metro hubs

Time-based race views (year/month)

Detail pages for races and routes

Collection pages (“best of”, “flat races”, “NYC April races”, etc.)

Required URL patterns (include these exactly, plus any you add)

Races

/races/ (USA race hub)

/races/usa/ (USA overview)

/races/state/{state-slug}/

/races/state/{state-slug}/city/{city-slug}/

/races/year/{yyyy}/

/races/year/{yyyy}/month/{mm}/

/races/{race-slug}/ (race detail; include state/city in the page content and breadcrumbs even if not in URL)

Routes

/routes/

/routes/state/{state-slug}/

/routes/state/{state-slug}/city/{city-slug}/

/routes/{route-slug}/ (route detail)

Tools (must link out to AITracker.run)

/tools/ (tools hub)

/tools/race-predictor/ (landing page with CTA that links to AITracker)

/tools/pace-calculator/ (can be on running.services or link out; design for both)

/tools/training-plan/ (CTA to AITracker)

/tools/vo2-estimator/ (CTA to AITracker)
Every tool page must include a clear “Open in AITracker” button and a short explanation of what happens there.

Guides

/guides/

/guides/{guide-slug}/
Plus collection pages: /guides/topic/{topic-slug}/ (e.g., marathon-training, injury-prevention, fueling)

Page templates (must define sections/components)

Create templates for these page types with consistent reusable components:

USA Hub Page (for races + routes)

hero search (location, distance, month)

featured collections (e.g., “Best Spring Half Marathons”)

state grid (50 states)

internal links to top metros

tools CTA module linking to AITracker

State Hub Page

intro block

filters + list (races or routes)

top cities in state

“popular collections in {state}”

related guides + tools module

City Hub Page

quick filters (distance, date range, surface, elevation bucket)

list results + map toggle (map can be a placeholder UI)

“top routes near {city}” (if on races page) and vice versa

“seasonality” module (months)

local guide links + AITracker CTA

Time View Pages (year/month)

calendar-like layout + list

filters: distance, state, city, weekend-only

“top collections this month”

Race Detail Page
Must include modules:

hero title + key facts panel (date, distance, city/state, surface, elevation if known, website/registration link)

course profile section (placeholder if unknown)

“who it’s good for” (rules-based bullets)

logistics (start time, cutoff, bib, parking/public transit placeholder)

weather norms placeholder

“similar races” carousel

“train for this race” module with CTA to AITracker (race predictor + plan builder)

Route Detail Page
Must include:

map placeholder, distance, elevation gain, surface mix, route type (loop/out-and-back), safety notes placeholder

GPX download placeholder

“pace plan / workout ideas” with CTA to AITracker tools

“nearby routes”

“races near this route” (cross-link)

Tools Hub Page

grid of tools (some hosted on running.services later, but for now all have “Open in AITracker”)

include “Why AITracker” card

include “Free vs Pro” placeholder section

Collection Page Template (programmatic SEO)
Examples: “Flat marathons in USA”, “Best fall half marathons in California”, “5K races in NYC in April”

dynamic H1

short intro paragraph area (templated)

filters + ranked list

“related collections”

guide + tools modules

Filters / taxonomy (define these clearly)

Races filters:

distance category (5K/10K/HM/Marathon/Ultra/Other)

date range + month

state + city

surface (road/trail/track/mixed)

elevation bucket (flat/rolling/hilly — based on data if available)

“weekend only”

price bucket (if data exists; otherwise hide gracefully)

Routes filters:

distance range

elevation gain range

surface

route type (loop/out-and-back/point-to-point)

terrain (road/trail/park paths)

“stroller-friendly” (optional)

“night-friendly” (optional placeholder)

Filters should be designed as a left sidebar on desktop + bottom sheet on mobile.

Internal linking rules (SEO)

Every page must have:

breadcrumbs

“related” modules (related races, routes, collections, guides)

cross-linking: race → train/tools; route → workouts/tools; city/state → top collections

footer with state links + popular collections

Branding + UI constraints

Clean, modern, fast directory aesthetic

Mobile-first, accessible typography

Design for thousands of pages (template-driven)

Include a subtle but persistent cross-brand element: “Powered by AITracker tools” without making it feel like an ad.

Output format

Provide:

A structured sitemap (bulleted)

A table of page types → components/modules

A list of reusable UI components (SearchBar, FilterChips, ResultCard, StatsPanel, RelatedCarousel, CTA to AITracker, etc.)

Wireframe-level layout descriptions (no need for full pixel-perfect mockups, but be concrete)

Do NOT build backend code. Focus on IA, templates, and component structure that a dev can implement in Next.js.
